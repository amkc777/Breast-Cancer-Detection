# Breast Cancer Detection

## Description

Health is an essential aspect of everyone's life. Breast cancer is a type of cancer that can affect both males and females when the cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These abnormal cells typically form a tumor, which can be felt as a lump or detected through medical imaging such as an x-ray. Breast cancer can be classified as either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

This repository aims to provide resources and tools for breast cancer detection and analysis. It includes various algorithms and models developed to assist in identifying and diagnosing breast cancer.
